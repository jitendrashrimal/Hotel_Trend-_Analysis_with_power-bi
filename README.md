2. Revenue Trends:
   - Displays revenue generated from various services (room bookings, food and beverage, events).
   - Tracks revenue performance against targets and historical data.
3. Booking Patterns:
   - Analyzes booking sources (online, direct, third-party) and their contributions to overall bookings.
   - Identifies popular booking periods and customer preferences.
4. Customer Satisfaction:
   - Visualizes customer feedback and satisfaction scores from surveys and reviews.
   - Identifies key areas for improvement based on customer feedback.
5. Comparative Analysis   - Compares performance metrics across different hotels or branches.
   - Provides benchmarking data to identify top-performing and underperforming units.
     
Possible Solutions After Sales Forecasting
1. Weekend Offers on Meals:
   - Introduce special meal offers during weekends to attract more customers and enhance dining revenue.
2. Additional Day Combo Offers:
   - Implement additional day combo offers to increase occupancy and revenue. These packages encourage longer stays by providing discounted rates for extended bookings.
3. Higher Prices for Same-Day Bookings:
   - Adjust pricing strategy to include higher rates for same-day bookings, capitalizing on last-minute demand to maximize revenue.
4. Gala Events on Public Holidays:
   - Organize gala events on public holidays such as Holi, Christmas, or New Year’s Eve. These events can attract more guests and increase overall occupancy and revenue.
5. Event/Business Conference Bookings:
   - Promote the booking of events and business conferences in the hotel’s hall. This can generate additional revenue streams and increase the hotel’s visibility within the corporate sector.
6. Price Adjustment for Standard Room Category:
   - Consider decreasing the price of Room Type 1 (RT1) by 5%. This price reduction could potentially increase bookings in the standard room category, enhancing overall occupancy rates.
7. Revised Refund Policies for Cancellations:
   - Review and modify the refund policies for urgent and near-term bookings. Implementing a no-refund policy for urgent cancellations could increase revenue by approximately 147 million rupees.

These solutions are designed to enhance the hotel's revenue, optimize occupancy, and improve customer satisfaction through targeted offers and strategic adjustments.
